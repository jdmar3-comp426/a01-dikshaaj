        <h2 class="center">Third Incarnation of Lord Vishnu</h1>
        <p>
            Lord Vishnu's third Avatar (incarnation) was in response to the
            demon Hiranyaksha. At this time, the Earth was rampant with sin,
            and Hiranyaksha was only thriving in this environment. He started 
            worshipping Lord Brahma to become more powerful. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Impressed with his penance, Lord Brahma came down to bless
            Hiranyaksha with a boon. The boon he asked for was to not be 
            defeated by any man or God, and a list of animals, but he 
            forgot to mention a boar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hiranyaksha carried on tormenting humans on Earth and one day, 
            he abudcted Mother Earth and hid her. This was when Lord Vishnu
            was asked to intervene and save the Earth. Knowing that the only 
            being he could be defeated by was a boar, Lord Vishnu incarnated 
            as such and challenged Hiranyaksha to a fight. The boar first
            carried Mother Earth back onto her axis, then fought with 
            Hiranyaksha, ultimately defeating him and restoring balance to 
            the world.
