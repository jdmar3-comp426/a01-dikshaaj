            <h2 class="center">The Indian mythological tale of Lord Narsimha</h2>
        </div>
        <p id="p1">
            In Hinduism, one of the <a href="page1.html">three main Gods</a> that control the universe. <i>Lord Vishnu</i> is known as the "sustainer" of the universe and he has been known to incarnate in different forms on Earth to keep the balance of good and evil. This is the story of his <a href="page2.html">fourth incarnation</a>, <i>Narasimha</i>.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            During <i>Lord Vishnu's</i> <a href="page3.html">third incarnation</a>, he killed the demon <i>Hiranyaksha</i>. His brother, <i>Hiranyakashipu</i>, wanted to exact revenge for his brother's death by destroying <i>Lord Vishnu</i> and His followers. He prayed to <i>Lord Brahma</i>, the God of creation, by performing extreme penance. <i>Lord Brahma</i>, impressed, offered <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> anything he wanted.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> initially wanted to the boon of not dying, or being immortal, but <i>Lord Brahma</i> said he could not give him immortality, but could give him anything else. <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> asked for a tricky boon - that he would not die on earth or in space; not in fire or water; not at day or night; neither inside or outside of a home; not by a human, animal, or God; neither by inanimate or animate being. Lord Brahma granted him this boon.
        </p>
        <div class="special">
            <p id="p4">
                With no fear of death, <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> unleashed terror on the Earth. He declared himself as God and ordered people to say no God's name except his. However, this changed when his son, <i>Prahlada</i> was born.
            </p>
            <p id="p5">
                <i>Prahlada</i> grew up and became a devoted follower of <i>Lord Vishnu</i>. Despite the extreme circumstances that his father put him through, <i>Prahlada</i>'s devotion and faith continues to grow to be stronger.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p id="p6">
            One day, <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> challenged <i>Prahlada</i>'s belief of God's omnipresence. <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> asked, <br>"Even in this pillar?", laughing. <i>Prahlada</i> insisted that He was. <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> scoffed, and in anger cut down the pillar.
        </p>
        <p id="p7">
            Suddenly, a half-man half-God, half-human and half-lion emerged from the pillar. At twilight, <i>Lord Narasimha</i> fights <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> on the doorstep and places him on His lap, using his nails to kill him. His death was by neither man nor God, neither human nor animal, not at day or night, not in space or on Earth, not by inanimate object or animate.
        </p>
        <p id="p8">
            The death of the demon king <i>Hiranyakashipu</i> is celebrated as Holi in India every spring.
